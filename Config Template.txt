This is the template for how the config file will be set out. The file will be collections of key headings [SomeKey] followed by a number of flags on each newline. The following example is what a config file would look like with n flags for a key Key1 and m values for a key Key2:
[Key1]
FLAG1
FLAG2
...
FLAGn

[Key2]
OTHER_FLAG1
OTHER_FLAG2
...
OTHER_FLAGm

Special case is the MISC key. It will be as follows:
[MISC]
FrameRate=60

In this case it will set the variable frameRate to 60. The "FrameRate" to frameRate is hard coded.
The coded representation of this is a map with a string key (key heading in the file) and with the a vector of flags (every newline is a new index) as its element.
