Changelist:
0.2.0:
Compiled debug build.
Changed Potato::Graphics::Initialise to include checking for loaded libraries success.

0.1.3:
Finished Potato::Graphics::Initialise.
Created source for Potato::Graphics members:
	- Cleanup
	- Graphics

0.1.2:
Added SLD_Surface* display to Potato::Graphics as a private member, this is the output screen.
Added SDL_image flags to optionFlags.
Changed LoadConfig to include an IMGLOADER case for SDL_image.
Flags will now have a constructor value of 0xFFFFFFFF.
Changed LoadConfig so that all basic flag loading cases now check whether to assign or to OR the loading value, uses the new constructor value to differentiate.
Changes Potato::Graphics::Initialise significantly:
	- now assigns the output SDL_Surface* from SDL_SetVideoMode
	- now calls SDL_image's initialiser IMG_Init, calls with flags.
Created source code for the following Potato::Graphics methods:
	- Render
	- Renderloop
	- LoadAssets
Changed Potato::Graphics::ConfigSegments to utilise new Potato::Strings::ReadFile functionality.
Changed Potato::RenderObject significantly:
	- removed vector of SDL_Surface*'s, now only one surface is used
	- added vector<Pair> of locations and sizes of animation states on the one SDL_Surface*
	- added string name

0.1.1:
Changed default parameter for Potato::RenderObject::Animate to be in the header declaration rather than in the definition.
Completed Potato::Graphics::LoadConfig.
Changed all render vectors to be vectors of RenderObject* not SDL_Surface*.
Changed all pending render vectors to be private.
Compressed render vectors into one vector, changed entity sheet accordingly.
Compressed pending render vectors into one vector, changed entity sheet accordingly.
Added ConfigSegments function - it takes no parameters but returns a map of the configuration (See config template file for how this is set out).
Created config file template.
Created source code for the following Potato::Graphics methods:
	- Configure
	- Update
	- Delay
	- ConfigSegments (see above for details)

0.1.0:
Created c++ project.
Created class Potato::Graphics.
Created struct Potato::RenderObject.
Created source code for Potato::RenderObject::Animate.
In progress source code:
	- Potato::Graphics::Initialise
		Almost complete
	- Potato::Graphics::LoadConfig
		Currently hard coding string mappings for SDL flags
	
0.0.4:
Created Delay flowchart.
Created Graphics Engine entity sheet, note: OBG and OFG stand for OptionsBackGround and OptionsForeGround respectively.
Created Render Object entity sheet.
Changed Animate flowchart to directly contain flow for getting time change and updating attributes within parent RenderObject.
Changed Initialise flowchart to reference GetConfiguration as a function rather than document operation.

0.0.3:
Created data types mind map.
Created manifest template.
Created flowcharts for the following methods:
	- LoadAssets
	- Render
	- Animate
Changed the Initialise flowchart to call LoadAssets rather than having it as a process.

0.0.2:
Created flowcharts for the following methods:
	- Initialise
	- Renderloop
	- Update
	- Configure
	- Cleanup
	
0.0.1:
Created project.
