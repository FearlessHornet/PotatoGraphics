========================================================================

This is a SDL graphics engine to be used in an overarching game engine.

Currently the project is being written in visual studio 2012; so it has
stdafx files.

The project is being built with only windows in mind at this point in
time, localised builds for linux distro's may be supported after the
game engine has been finished.

This project was started to improve my programming ability and is currently
in no releasable state. The project is filled with a lot of "dirty fixes"
but this is part of my pass by pass style I am trying. The final release
will be a dynamic link library with the debug code removed.
